# We love cloud development!

In the last few decades, we at MaibornWolff have developed a whole range of good practices for sustainable architecture from many software development projects for our customers. The reservations of large companies regarding the use of cloud services have significantly decreased. As a result of this development, the number of consumers is growing rapidly and the number of services offered.

Many of our good practices can be applied directly or indirectly to cloud-native applications. The basis has always been a component-oriented design that can be used in classic software architectures and large, decentralized architectures. We build components from a closed technical domain and combine them with corresponding cloud resources to form a complete application. This works for coarse application services, microservices, and fine-grained serverless architectures.

We are happy to share our experiences with everyone in this cloud-native architecture guide. Over time, we will publish individual chapters for infrastructure-, code-, serverless- and delivery architecture!

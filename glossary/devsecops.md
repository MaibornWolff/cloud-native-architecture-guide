# DevSecOps

DevSecOps is an approach that integrates security practices throughout the entire software development and deployment lifecycle. The name combines Development (Dev), Security (Sec), and Operations (Ops), emphasizing that security is a shared responsibility integrated from the beginning rather than added as an afterthought. This methodology extends the DevOps philosophy by ensuring that security considerations are addressed with the same level of automation, tooling, and integration as other aspects of the software delivery pipeline, effectively implementing the concept of "security as code."

In modern software development environments, DevSecOps addresses the limitations of traditional security approaches where security was often a separate phase conducted at the end of development, creating bottlenecks and resulting in costly late-stage vulnerability discoveries. By shifting security left and making it an integral part of every development stage, organizations can deliver secure applications at DevOps speed. This approach transforms security from being perceived as a roadblock to becoming an enabler of rapid, reliable software delivery, allowing teams to balance the competing demands of speed and security in today's fast-paced digital landscape.

## Shift Left Security

The core principle of DevSecOps is "shifting left" security, which means moving security considerations and practices earlier in the software development lifecycle. This approach fundamentally changes how organizations think about security by transforming it from a late-stage gate or audit into an ongoing process that begins with the earliest planning stages. By integrating security throughout the development process, teams can identify and address vulnerabilities when they are easiest and least expensive to fix, rather than discovering them in production where remediation costs can be up to 30 times higher.

Shifting left requires implementing automated security testing at multiple stages of the development pipeline. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) analyzes source code for security vulnerabilities during development, while Software Composition Analysis (SCA) identifies vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies and open source components. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) test running applications for vulnerabilities that might only appear during execution. These automated tools provide immediate feedback to developers, enabling them to address security issues as part of their normal workflow rather than waiting for separate security reviews.

Beyond tools, shifting left security also involves cultural and process changes. Security teams transition from being gatekeepers who approve or reject completed work to becoming enablers who provide expertise, tools, and guidance throughout the development process. Developers receive security training to understand common vulnerabilities and secure coding practices, while security requirements are defined alongside functional requirements during planning. This comprehensive approach ensures that security becomes a shared responsibility across all teams, fostering a culture where secure development is the default rather than an afterthought.

## Good Practices

Implement automated security testing at every stage of the CI/CD pipeline, including SAST for code analysis, SCA for dependency scanning, and DAST for testing running applications.

Establish a "security as code" approach by defining security policies, compliance requirements, and infrastructure hardening as code that can be version-controlled, tested, and automatically applied.

Create a security champions program that embeds security-focused team members within development teams to provide guidance, raise awareness, and advocate for security best practices.

Conduct regular threat modeling sessions during the design phase to identify potential security risks early and incorporate appropriate controls into the architecture.

Implement comprehensive security monitoring and automated incident response capabilities to quickly detect and address security issues in production environments.

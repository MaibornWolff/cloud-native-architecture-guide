# Version Control

Version Control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing teams to track modifications, compare versions, and revert to previous states when needed. At its core, version control serves as a historical database of changes, providing a complete audit trail of who modified what, when, and why. Modern version control systems maintain this history using repositories that store not just the current files, but the entire timeline of changes made to them. This enables developers to understand how a codebase has evolved, identify when and why specific changes were introduced, and recover from mistakes by reverting to previous stable versions. The fundamental purpose of version control is to facilitate collaboration while maintaining the integrity and stability of shared resources.

In the DevOps context, version control forms the foundation for automated build, test, and deployment pipelines. DevOps practices require that all production artifacts—including application code, infrastructure configurations, database schemas, and deployment scripts—be stored in version control systems. This approach, often called "everything as code," ensures that all components of a system can be reliably recreated, audited, and rolled back if necessary. Version control enables key DevOps practices such as continuous integration, where code changes are automatically tested upon commit, and continuous delivery, where validated changes can be deployed to production with minimal manual intervention. By providing a single source of truth for all project assets, version control facilitates the collaboration, traceability, and automation that are essential to successful DevOps implementations.

## Types of Version Control Systems

Version control systems broadly fall into two categories: centralized and distributed, each with distinct architectures and workflows that impact how teams collaborate. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) like Subversion (SVN) use a single central repository that stores all versioned files. Developers check out files from this central location, make changes locally, and then commit those changes back to the central repository. While this model is straightforward and provides a clear governance structure, it creates a single point of failure—if the central server goes down, no one can collaborate or save versioned changes. Additionally, most operations require a network connection to the central server, which can impact performance and limit offline work capabilities.

Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) like Git, Mercurial, and Bazaar take a fundamentally different approach by giving each developer a complete local copy of the entire repository history. This architectural difference offers several significant advantages: developers can work offline with full version control capabilities, committing changes locally before pushing them to shared repositories; branching and merging operations are faster and more flexible, enabling more sophisticated workflows; and the distributed nature provides inherent backup and redundancy, as each clone of the repository contains the full history. Git has emerged as the dominant DVCS due to its speed, flexibility, and robust branching model, which supports parallel development through feature branches, release branches, and other specialized workflows. The distributed model aligns particularly well with DevOps practices, as it enables more experimental, iterative development while maintaining the ability to integrate changes frequently through continuous integration systems.

## Good Practices

Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain both what changed and why it changed, enabling future developers to understand the context and purpose of historical modifications without having to reverse-engineer the code.

Implement a consistent branching strategy such as GitFlow or Trunk-Based Development that aligns with your team's size, release cadence, and quality requirements.

Keep commits focused and atomic, making a single logical change in each commit rather than combining unrelated changes, which improves reviewability and makes it easier to revert specific changes if needed.

Regularly integrate changes from the main branch into feature branches to reduce merge conflicts and ensure compatibility with ongoing work from other team members.

Store all production artifacts—including application code, configuration, infrastructure definitions, database schemas, and deployment scripts—in version control to enable reproducibility of environments and deployments.

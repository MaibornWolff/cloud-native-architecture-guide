# Cloud-Native

Cloud-native is an approach to designing, building, and operating applications that fully leverages the advantages of cloud computing. Rather than simply migrating traditional applications to the cloud ("lift and shift"), cloud-native applications are specifically architected to thrive in cloud environments, taking advantage of their scalability, resilience, and flexibility.

Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. This approach embraces microservices architecture, containerization, orchestration, and DevOps practices to enable faster development cycles, improved resilience, and more efficient resource utilization. Organizations adopting cloud-native principles can respond more quickly to market changes and deliver value to customers at an accelerated pace.

Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach." - [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/charter.md)

## Core Architectural Principles

Cloud-native architecture is built on several foundational principles that distinguish it from traditional application design. **Microservices architecture** breaks applications into small, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This approach enables teams to work autonomously, accelerates development cycles, and allows for more granular scaling compared to monolithic applications. Each microservice typically has a specific business function and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs.

**Containerization** is a fundamental enabler of cloud-native applications, providing lightweight, isolated environments that package application code together with its dependencies. Containers ensure consistency across different environments, from development to production, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem. Container orchestration platforms like **Kubernetes** automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, handling tasks such as service discovery, load balancing, and self-healing.

The cloud-native approach embraces **declarative APIs** rather than imperative programming for system configuration. Instead of specifying step-by-step instructions for how to achieve a desired state, declarative systems allow developers to specify what the desired state should be, and the system works to maintain that state. This approach enables self-healing capabilities, as the system continuously reconciles the actual state with the desired state, automatically correcting discrepancies without human intervention.

## Good Practices

Design applications with a "stateless-first" mindset, externalizing state to managed services when possible to improve scalability and simplify deployment, while maintaining clear boundaries between stateful and stateless components.

Implement comprehensive observability through monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing to gain visibility into the behavior and performance of distributed microservices, making troubleshooting and optimization more effective.

Adopt infrastructure as code (IaC) practices to define and manage infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual processes, ensuring consistency and enabling version control for infrastructure configurations.

Embrace continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes, reducing the risk of errors and accelerating the delivery of new features to users.

Design for resilience by implementing patterns such as circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation to ensure applications can withstand failures in individual components without complete system outages.

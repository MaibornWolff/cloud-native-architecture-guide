# FinOps

FinOps (Financial Operations) is a collaborative practice that brings financial accountability to the variable spend model of cloud computing. It enables organizations to make informed trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality in their cloud operations through cross-functional collaboration and shared ownership. The practice combines systems, best practices, and culture to increase an organization's ability to understand cloud costs and make business-driven decisions around cloud usage, helping teams optimize their cloud resources while maintaining the agility and innovation benefits of cloud computing.

In the DevOps context, FinOps bridges the traditional gap between finance, technology, and business teams by creating a common language and shared responsibility model for cloud costs. While DevOps focuses on breaking down silos between development and operations to deliver software faster, FinOps extends this collaborative approach to include financial considerations. This integration is particularly important in cloud environments where resources can be provisioned instantly and costs can scale unpredictably without proper governance. FinOps practices help organizations maintain the speed and flexibility benefits of cloud while ensuring financial sustainability and accountability.

> "FinOps is an evolving cloud financial management discipline and cultural practice that enables organizations to get maximum business value by helping engineering, finance, technology and business teams to collaborate on data-driven spending decisions." - [FinOps Foundation](https://www.finops.org/introduction/what-is-finops/)

## The FinOps Lifecycle

The FinOps practice typically follows a continuous lifecycle with three core phases that organizations cycle through repeatedly as they mature their cloud financial management capabilities. The **Inform** phase focuses on visibility and allocation, providing teams with accurate, accessible data about their cloud costs and establishing accountability through proper tagging and allocation mechanisms. This creates the foundation for informed decision-making by making cloud costs transparent and understandable to all stakeholders, from engineers to finance teams to executives.

Once teams have visibility into their costs, they move to the **Optimize** phase, where they take action to improve cloud efficiency based on business requirements. This includes technical optimizations like right-sizing resources, leveraging spot instances, implementing auto-scaling, and eliminating waste, as well as financial optimizations like reserved capacity planning and discount management. The optimization strategies balance cost reduction with performance needs and business priorities, recognizing that the cheapest option isn't always the best business decision.

The final phase, **Operate**, embeds FinOps practices into the organization's daily operations through automation, policies, and cultural reinforcement. This includes implementing automated policies for cost control, establishing regular review cadences, managing budgets, and continuously refining allocation models. As organizations mature, they increasingly automate cost optimization and governance, allowing teams to focus on innovation while maintaining financial discipline. The cycle then begins again with enhanced information gathering, creating a continuous improvement loop that adapts to changing business needs and cloud offerings.

## Good Practices

Implement comprehensive tagging strategies that enable accurate cost allocation to business units, products, environments, and teams, making cloud spending transparent and accountable to those who generate it.

Establish a cross-functional FinOps team or center of excellence with representation from engineering, finance, and business stakeholders to drive collaboration and shared ownership of cloud financial management.

Integrate cost awareness into the development process by providing engineers with visibility into the cost implications of their design decisions and recognizing cost optimization as a form of technical excellence.

Implement automated policies and guardrails that prevent costly mistakes while still allowing teams the flexibility they need to innovate, such as shutting down non-production resources during off-hours or setting budget alerts.

Balance cost optimization with business value by measuring unit economics (cost per transaction, customer, or feature) rather than focusing solely on absolute spending, recognizing that increased cloud costs may be justified by proportional business growth.

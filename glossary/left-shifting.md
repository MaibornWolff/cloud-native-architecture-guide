# Left Shifting

Left shifting is the practice of moving activities traditionally performed later in the software development lifecycle to earlier stages. This approach is visualized on a timeline where tasks shift leftward, hence the name. The core principle of left shifting is to identify and resolve issues as early as possible in the development process, when they are less costly and easier to fix. By integrating testing, security, and quality assurance activities earlier, organizations can improve software quality, reduce time to market, and lower the overall cost of development.

In the DevOps context, left shifting represents a fundamental shift in mindset from reactive problem-solving to proactive prevention. Traditional development models often treated testing, security, and operations concerns as downstream activities, leading to late-stage discoveries of issues that were expensive and time-consuming to address. DevOps embraces left shifting by breaking down silos between teams and integrating these concerns throughout the development process. This integration is supported by automation, shared responsibility, and collaborative practices that enable continuous feedback and improvement. Left shifting aligns perfectly with DevOps principles of fast feedback, continuous improvement, and shared ownership of quality.

> "Shift left refers to a practice in software development in which teams focus on quality, work on problem prevention instead of detection, and begin testing earlier than usual in the development cycle." - [IBM Engineering](https://www.ibm.com/topics/shift-left)

## Implementation Areas and Benefits

Left shifting can be applied to multiple aspects of the software development lifecycle, with testing and security being the most common areas of focus. **Left shifted testing** involves integrating testing activities throughout the development process rather than treating them as a separate phase that occurs after development is complete. This approach includes practices such as test-driven development (TDD), where tests are written before the code; continuous integration, which automatically tests code changes as they are committed; and automated testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, system). By catching defects earlier, left shifted testing reduces the cost of fixing issues, shortens feedback loops, and improves overall code quality.

**Left shifted security**, often referred to as DevSecOps, integrates security practices and tools from the beginning of the development process rather than treating security as a final gate before production. This approach includes practices such as automated security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline, threat modeling during design phases, security requirements as part of user stories, and developer security training. By addressing security concerns earlier, organizations can build more secure applications from the ground up, reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities reaching production, and avoid costly late-stage security fixes or redesigns. Left shifted security also helps organizations maintain compliance with regulatory requirements by making security a continuous consideration rather than a point-in-time assessment.

The benefits of left shifting extend beyond just quality and security improvements. Organizations that successfully implement left shifting typically experience faster time to market by reducing rework and streamlining the development process. Development costs decrease as issues are identified and resolved when they are less expensive to fix. Team collaboration improves as different specialties (development, testing, security, operations) work together earlier in the process, fostering shared understanding and responsibility. Customer satisfaction increases due to higher quality releases with fewer defects and security vulnerabilities. Perhaps most importantly, left shifting creates a culture of quality and security consciousness, where these concerns become everyone's responsibility rather than being delegated to specialized teams at the end of the process.

## Good Practices

Implement automated testing at all levels (unit, integration, system) and integrate these tests into the CI/CD pipeline to provide immediate feedback on code changes and prevent defects from progressing further in the development cycle.

Incorporate security scanning tools and vulnerability assessments into the development workflow, enabling developers to identify and address security issues during coding rather than waiting for later security reviews.

Adopt test-driven development (TDD) or behavior-driven development (BDD) approaches that require defining tests before writing code, ensuring that quality is built in from the beginning rather than added later.

Create cross-functional teams that include testing, security, and operations expertise alongside development, fostering shared responsibility for quality and breaking down traditional silos between these disciplines.

Establish clear quality and security requirements at the beginning of projects and include them in definition of done criteria for user stories, making these non-functional requirements as important as functional ones.

# Continuous Integration and Deployment

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) are foundational practices in modern software development that automate the process of integrating code changes and delivering software to production environments. These practices aim to improve software delivery speed, quality, and predictability by creating reliable, repeatable processes that minimize manual intervention. By automating the build, test, and deployment phases of the software development lifecycle, CI/CD enables teams to detect issues earlier, release more frequently, and respond more quickly to customer feedback and market changes.

As Humble and Farley detail in "Continuous Delivery", CI/CD provides a systematic approach and emphasis on measurement, learning, and faster feedback which are key principles behind DevOps.

In DevOps environments, CI/CD forms the backbone of the technical implementation of DevOps principles. Continuous Integration addresses the challenge of integrating work from multiple developers by automatically verifying that new code changes integrate properly with existing code. Continuous Delivery and Deployment extend this automation to the release process, ensuring that software can be reliably released at any time. These practices reduce deployment risk, eliminate manual handoffs between teams, and create a more collaborative environment where developers take greater ownership of the entire software delivery process.

> "Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible." - [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html)

## CI/CD Pipeline Stages

A **CI/CD pipeline** is the automated implementation of the software delivery process and typically consists of distinct stages that code changes must pass through before reaching production. The pipeline begins with the Continuous Integration phase, where developers frequently commit their code to a shared repository. Each commit triggers an automated build process that compiles the code, runs unit tests, and performs static code analysis to identify issues early in the development cycle. This immediate feedback allows developers to address problems when they are easiest and least expensive to fix.

Once code passes the CI phase, it enters the Continuous Delivery portion of the pipeline. In this stage, the application undergoes more comprehensive testing, including integration tests, system tests, and performance tests in environments that closely resemble production. The goal is to verify not just that individual components work correctly in isolation, but that they function properly together and meet performance requirements. Automated security scans and compliance checks may also be performed at this stage to ensure the application meets security standards and regulatory requirements.

The final stage of the pipeline is Continuous Deployment, where approved changes are automatically deployed to production without manual intervention. While Continuous Delivery ensures that code is always in a deployable state but requires manual approval for production deployment, Continuous Deployment takes automation a step further by removing the manual approval step. This approach requires high confidence in the automated testing process and typically includes additional safeguards such as feature flags, canary releases, or blue-green deployments to mitigate risk. Robust monitoring and automated rollback capabilities are essential components of Continuous Deployment, enabling teams to quickly detect and address any issues that arise in production.

## Good Practices

Implementing comprehensive automated testing at multiple levels (unit, integration, system) to build confidence in the CI/CD pipeline and catch issues before they reach production. As Jez Humble stated, with continuous and fast feedback processes in place, your team will easily achieve their intended goals.

Maintain a trunk-based development approach with short-lived feature branches to minimize merge conflicts and keep integration frequent and manageable. As seen in the real world of many teams now, with trunk-based development, you now understand the team dynamics, and everyone benefits.

Use infrastructure as code to ensure consistent environments across the pipeline, reducing "works on my machine" problems and environment-related deployment failures. Use version control too.

Implement feature flags to decouple deployment from release, allowing teams to deploy code to production while controlling when features are made available to users. Using feature flags allows for more efficient team performance.

Design the CI/CD pipeline to provide fast feedback, prioritizing quick-running tests early in the pipeline and optimizing build processes to minimize wait times for developers. As Humble and Farley point out, the key to fast feedback is automation.

**[Diagram 3: Relationship of all aspects]**

*Description: All aspects of each of your testing, staging, and production environments should specifically the configuration of any third-party elements of your system, should be applied from version control through an automated process.
*   That means operating systems, patch levels, OS configuration, your application stack, its configuration, infrastructure configuration, and so forth should all be managed.

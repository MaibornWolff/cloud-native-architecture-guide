# Canary Releases

Canary releases (or canary deployments) are a deployment strategy where a new version of an application is gradually rolled out to a small subset of users or servers before being deployed to the entire infrastructure. This approach allows teams to test changes in a production environment with minimal risk, gathering real-world feedback and performance data before committing to a full deployment.

The term "canary" refers to the historical practice of coal miners using canaries as early warning systems for toxic gases. Similarly, canary releases act as an early warning system for potential issues in software deployments. By exposing only a small percentage of users to new code, organizations can detect problems before they affect the entire user base, balancing the desire for rapid innovation with the need for system stability and reliability.

> "A canary release is a technique to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users before rolling it out to the entire infrastructure and making it available to everybody." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle#Canary_release)

## Implementation Approaches

Canary releases can be implemented through several technical approaches, each with distinct advantages depending on the infrastructure and application architecture. **Traffic splitting** is the most common implementation method, where a specific percentage of users or requests are routed to the new version while the majority continue to use the stable version. This can be achieved through load balancer configurations, service mesh implementations, or application-level routing logic.

The granularity of canary deployments can vary significantly based on organizational needs. Some teams implement **user segment routing**, directing specific user groups (such as internal employees, beta testers, or users who have opted in) to the canary version. Others use **geographical routing**, deploying new versions to specific regions or data centers first. These approaches allow for targeted exposure to minimize risk while still gathering meaningful feedback from representative user populations.

Monitoring and metrics collection form the foundation of successful canary releases. Teams must establish clear **success criteria** that determine whether a canary deployment proceeds to full rollout or gets rolled back. These criteria typically include error rates, latency measurements, resource utilization, and business metrics like conversion rates or user engagement. Automated canary analysis tools can compare these metrics between the canary and stable versions, applying statistical analysis to detect significant deviations that might indicate problems.

## Good Practices

Start small with low-risk features and minimal traffic exposure (1-5%), gradually increasing the canary footprint as confidence builds through positive metrics and user feedback.

Define clear, quantifiable success criteria for canary evaluation, including both technical metrics (error rates, latency) and business metrics (conversion rates, user engagement) with specific thresholds for promotion or rollback.

Implement comprehensive monitoring across all layers of the application stack, comparing canary metrics against the baseline version and alerting on significant deviations that might indicate problems.

Automate the canary deployment process, including progressive traffic shifting, metric collection, analysis, and rollback capabilities to ensure consistency and reduce manual intervention.

Design applications with backward and forward compatibility in mind, particularly for APIs and database schemas, to support multiple versions running simultaneously during the canary period.
